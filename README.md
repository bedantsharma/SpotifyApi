# SpotifyApi
downloads songs using web scraping
## Step 1
first run the song_link_collector.py file that will ask you to login with your spotify Api that will be used to collect the the name and links of the songs that are in your playlist 
## Step 2
run the main.py file to download all the songs that are in your playlists 
## Note:
if the code crashes on your system try chaning the chromedrive
i have macbook m1 air so i have use chromedrive-mac-arm64 but for a different system you might need a different chrome driver 
also you can change the number of threads that will run in your computer currently the number is set to 5 as it works fine for me but you lower the number if you don't have enough RAM.
